*******Components*******

Source: On-Prem SQL Server
Destination: ADLS and Azure Synapse
Tools: ADF, Databricks, Power BI


*******Activities Performed*******

1. Source data is on On-Prem SQL Server 
2. Migrate/ Copy data from On-Prem SQL Server to ADLS using ADF
3. Create Bronze, Silver, Gold levels in ADLS and transformations using Databricks
4. Develop reports in Power BI 
5. Use Azure Active Directory and key vaults for Secure Dataflow

*******Pipeline Development*******

1. Create secrets in Azure Key vault to store the Username and password of On-Prem SQL Server.
2. Create Self Hosted Integration Runtime for On-Premise
	ADF> Manage> IR> Create Self-hosted IR> Choose Express Setup or Manual Setup> IR is created

3. In ADF:
	1.Choose SQL Server as source DS.
	2.Choose the self hosted IR in linked Service and provide Server & DB names from SQL Server and use key vault secrets for the SQL Server password.
	3.Choose ADLS Gen2 as sink DS with parquet format.
	4.To loop across all tables in specific schema. Use the below query
	"select
	s.name as SchemaName, t.name as TableName
	from sys.tables t inner join sys.schema s
	on t.schema_id = s.schema_id where s.name = 'any specific schema' "
	
	5.Use the above query in lookup activity to fetch the list of tables.
	6.Feed the output of lookup with Array of schema names and table names to foreach activity.
	7.Create copy activity inside foreach.
	8.Declare the sink parameters for schema and table name to save the output file in format:
	  Bronze/Schema_name/table_name.parquet - Run the pipeline > now the bronze level data is READY!!
	9.Use Databricks to perform transformations and save as Gold Level table
	10.Include the Databricks notebooks in the ADF pipeline.

4.Import the Gold Level table and build a Power BI report.
